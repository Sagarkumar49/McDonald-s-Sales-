This project analyzes McDonald's sales data (5,370 orders, $61,626.29 revenue) to uncover trends, optimize operations, and drive revenue growth. The interactive Excel dashboard highlights:

- Category/dish performance (Burgers = $21.6K, Meatball Marinara = top dish).

- Time-based trends (peak hours: 12–1 PM, weak day: Wednesday).

- Customer behavior (2.28 avg items/order, sides = most ordered).

**Business Impact:** Proposed strategies (e.g., combo deals, staffing adjustments) to boost revenue by 10–15%.

# 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Excel: PivotTables, Charts, Conditional Formatting, Dynamic Dashboards.

- Data Cleaning: Handling duplicates, null values (forward/backward fill).

- Analysis: Time-series trends, segmentation, comparative metrics.

# 📂 Dataset

- Source: McDonald's Sales Dataset

- Scope: 5,370 orders, $61,626.29 revenue, multiple categories (Burgers, Chicken, Fries, etc.).

- Variables: Order time, item name, category, quantity, revenue.

# 🚀 Methodology

**1. Data Preparation**
- Cleaned data by removing duplicates and filling null values.

- Standardized categories (e.g., merged "Fries" and "Side Fries").

**2. Analysis & Visualization**
- Revenue Trends:

  - Created line charts for daily/weekly revenue (peak: Monday, dip: Wednesday).

  - Hourly heatmaps for order volume (12–1 PM = 15% of daily orders).

- Category Performance:

  - Bar charts comparing Burgers ($21.6K), Chicken ($12.4K), Fries ($9.2K).

  - Pie charts for order distribution (Sides = 32% of total orders).

- Top Dishes:

  - Ranked Meatball Marinara, Big Mac, Angus Third Pounder by sales.

**3. Dashboard Development**
- Built an interactive Excel dashboard with filters for:

  - Date ranges (e.g., Valentine’s Day vs. regular days).

  - Category/item drill-downs.

  - Time-of-day analysis.

# 🔍 Key Insights

1.**Burgers dominate revenue** (35% of total), but sides drive order volume.

2.**Valentine’s Day underperformed** ($683 revenue vs. daily avg ~$2K).

3.**Upsell potential:** Customers order 2.28 items/order; bundling sides could increase this.

# 💡 Recommendations

- Boost midweek sales: Wednesday promotions (e.g., "Buy 1 Burger, Get 1 Free").

- Peak-hour optimization: Increase staff during 12–1 PM and 6–7 PM.

- Seasonal menus: Promote pasta (popular on Valentine’s Day) for holidays.
